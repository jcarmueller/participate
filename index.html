<title>An Artist's Dream</title>

<body>
An artist is sleeping when a demon appears and turns his paintings to life. The demon taps the artist on the shoulder to wake him up and disappears. The artist wakes up to find that his paintings, two young women, have stepped out of their frames and are admiring themselves. The artist hugs one of them, but when he tries to hug her again she disappears. The same thing happens with the other woman. When the second woman vanishes, two more women appear and begin to lunge at the artist. He tries to shove them off but they don’t let go, so he grabs a nearby sword. As he is about to strike them with the sword, the two women turn into the devil and he puts the artist back to sleep. The artist wakes up to realize that it was all a dream. The element of magic is really interesting. I think it could also that it could be really fun to make a game that takes place in a dream sequence. 

The player is the artist and they are trying to figure out whether or not they are dreaming. Different types of people come at you from the paintings and you don’t know whether or not they will attack you or be nice to you. Your goal is to keep yourself as safe as possible until you wake back up. I think it would be cool to use a joystick for this game, but it could also work using the keyboard, probably just using an intuitive control scheme like the arrow keys.
